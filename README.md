# Azure DevOps PR Title Cleaner

A browser extension that automatically removes the "Merged" word from pull request titles in Azure DevOps auto-complete merge dialog.

## Why This Extension?

When completing pull requests in Azure DevOps, the system automatically generates commit messages with the format "Merged PR XXXXX: [Original Title]". However, many organizations have commit message policies that require clean, concise titles without the "Merged" prefix.

This extension automatically detects when you open the merge dialog and removes the "Merged" word from the commit message title, keeping the "PR XXXXX:" part, helping you comply with your organization's commit message policies.

## Features

- üöÄ **Automatic Detection**: Automatically detects Azure DevOps merge dialogs
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Auto-Checkbox**: Automatically clicks "Customize merge commit message" checkbox when found
- ‚úÇÔ∏è **Smart Cleaning**: Removes only the "Merged" word, preserving the "PR XXXXX:" part and your original title
- üîÑ **Real-time Processing**: Works as soon as the merge dialog opens
- üåê **Multi-tenant Support**: Works with dev.azure.com, visualstudio.com, and custom TFS instances
- üìù **Console Logging**: Provides feedback in browser console for debugging

## How It Works

The extension uses a content script that:

1. **Monitors the DOM** for Azure DevOps merge dialogs
2. **Automatically clicks** the "Customize merge commit message" checkbox if it's not already checked
3. **Detects title inputs** with the "Merged" word at the beginning
4. **Automatically cleans** the title by removing only the "Merged" word
5. **Preserves the "PR XXXXX:" part** and the original title that follows
6. **Triggers proper events** to ensure the UI updates correctly
